## Quizzy Pop

An interactive quiz game in the form of a web application.
The main languages used are HTML & CSS for the front-end and JavaScript for the backend.


# PROJECT PLANNING

This is an interactive single-player Quiz game.

As a finished product, we envision this game to have the following structure and properties:

- 4 categories of quiz, a player can choose from, each being a variation of a basic quiz game. The categories being
  - General Knowledge
  - Logos
  - Entertainment
  - GeoGuess

- Each of the above categories would individually have 3 levels - easy, medium, and hard - that a user must successively finish in order to be able to move to the next level. The user would be awarded with scores for each right answer, which will eventually help the user proceed to the highest level in that category.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The list of minimum viable product for this software contains the following:

1. As soon as the game launches, the user should be able to key in their name, immediately after which the user is redirected to the main menu of the game.
2. Working logic of a quiz wherein, if a user selects the right answer, the software indicates it as a success and if a user selects the wrong answer, the software indicates it as a failure.
